*M*ath *a*nd *G*raphics Tool*Z*
===============================

Some functions are so common that I tend to need them in all my applications. I've been lazy to structure a library and ended up with multiple copies all over the place. This is my attempt to learn Python packaging and to finally gather my common tools into one useful place.

- Number crunching tools:
  + Simple curve fitting.
  + Interpolation and splines.
- String and I/O tools:
  + File path manipulation.
  + Text compare
- Dictionary and List stuff:
  + Updating and useful comprehensions.
- General Utils:
  + Ranges and counters
- General engineering stuff:
  + Compressors
  + Fans
